## 2.8 Intermediate Code Generation

### 2.8.1

> For-statements in C and Java have the form:

> $$\text{for}~(~expr_1~;~expr_2~;~expr_3~)~stmt$$

> The first expression is executed before the loop; it is typically used for initialization the loop index. The second expression is a test made before each iterator of the loop; the loop is exited if the expression becomes 0. The loop itself can be thought of as the statement $$\{stmt~expr_3;\}$$. The third expression is executed at the end of each iteration; it is typically used to increment the loop index. The meaning of thefor-statement is similar to

> $$expr_1;~\text{while}~(~expr_2~)~\{~stmt~expr_3;~\}$$

> Define a class `For` for for-statements, similar to class `If1` in Fig. 2.43.

```java
class For extends Stmt {
    Expr expr1;
    Expr expr2;
    Expr expr3;
    Stmt stmt;
    
    public For(Expr e1, Expr e2, Expr e3, Stmt t) {
        expr1 = e1;
        expr2 = e2;
        expr3 = e3;
        stmt = t;
        before = newlabel();
        after = newlabel();
    }
    
    public void gen() {
        expr1.gen();
        emit(before + ":");
        emit("ifFalse " + expr2.rvalue().toString() + " goto " + after);
        stmt.gen();
        expr3.gen();
        emit("goto " + before);
        emit(after + ":");
    }
}
```

### 2.8.2

> The programming language C does not have a boolean type. Show how a C compiler might translate an if-statement into three-address code.

```
Expr n = Rel("!=", E.rvalue().toString(), 0).rvalue();
```
